fixed filename is bad for mcmc

standard map function
don't use pool

could also use fortran

class FakePool:    def map(self,f,y):        print f, y        return f(y)my_pool = FakePool()Sent 

sampler = emcee.EnsembleSampler(nwalkers, ndim, dp.makeLnLh,pool=my_pool)


use log10(Z) instead of Z


config file for fortran


3D scatter plot of log10(Z), m1,m2


start using log period as well

change make binary file to four dimensions and array! 

brush up on BSE readme
