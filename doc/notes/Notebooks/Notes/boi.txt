====== Binary Things ======
Stellar evolution 1: Main Sequence
"stars are very similar to stars of other masses"

Ever-decreasing time scales as it moves through the elements of the sequence

We don't really care how much mass stars pass between each other (small amount)


===== Main Sequence (HR Diagram) =====

Opacity depends on kinds of atoms and density
Basically like a power ideal gas law
Differential equation
{{./equation002.png?type=equation}}
z~ composition
p~ density
T~ temperature

Core is important because core is typicallly more dense than the outer shell
Hydrogen is annoying to burn alone - once you begin to burn more elements you begin to catalyze the burning of the star
A little contaminants can drastically change sequence (fucking differentials)
Burn 10% of mass (Hydrogen â†’ helium) 
Stars of different mass an characters transfer their energy differently

small stars - convective
((look up later))
electron capture supernova

===== Roche Potential =====
Pairs of stars
you can compute grav energy with hamiltonian mechanics

{{./equation003.png?type=equation}}

{{./equation004.png?type=equation}} = centrifugal potential

Gravitational equilibrium about the center of mass
If star expands past center of mass then it is transferred to other star
	orbit changes in response to mass transfer


ands past center of mass then it is transferred to other star
orbit changes in response to mass transfer
