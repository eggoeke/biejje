No, all the isotopes of Silver which have a higher mass number than 108 and 109 are unstable with half lives 
varying from seconds to days. Therefore, when silver absorbs a neutron its nuclei must become more unstable than before.

From the table included in this homework set and my understanding of half life I believe the slope of ln(Counts) vs ln(Seconds) 
graph I calculated is equal to t/half life. The calculate half life is 1.5 seconds, but the slope of the graph does not fit the 
curve very well.
